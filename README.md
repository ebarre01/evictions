# Evictions & Public Housing, Nashville, TN

Purpose: This map explores the relationship between affordable housing and evictions. It depicts eviction rates and eviction filing rates, by block group, from 2001-2016, as well as the locations of public housing and subsidized housing.

Data sources:
1. Eviction Lab: Reports the eviction rate and eviction filing rate by block group between 2001 and 2016.
2. Red Door Collective: Reports the eviction detainer warrants issued between 2020 and 2021.
3. Parcel data: MDHA owned properties as of 2019
4. National Housing Preservation Database: Reports subsidized housing in Nashville. Note that some of the timeframes do no overlap with the eviction rate data.

This project was produced as part of class project for Action Research | Fall 2021.
